**Welcome to my profile!** I'm currently a 🧑‍🎓 student at [I.T.I.S. Magistri Cumacini (CO)](https://www.magistricumacini.edu.it/), but
I've already started to work on some interesting projects, such as [@Abstract-Panthers](https://github.com/Abstract-Panthers).

- 🏍️ I like motorbikes, but I still don't have one
- ⚒️ The biggest project that I have ever worked on is [Hashcraft](https://github.com/LoRy24/Hashcraft)
- ☕ My favourite programming language is... Java 🥰

Mostly, my skills are derived by self learning during some years of Middle school. <br>
Today, I'm able to learn very fast all the things that I need in order to work <br> on something.
Thanks to this approach of mine, at the age of 16 y.o. I was able to work <br> 
pretty well on a lot of projects.
