- 🏍️ I like motorbikes, but I still don't have one
- ⚒️ The biggest project that I have ever worked on is [Hashcraft](https://github.com/LoRy24/Hashcraft)
- ☕ My favourite programming language is... Java 🥰

Mostly, my skills are derived by self learning during some years of Middle school. Today, I'm able to learn very fast all the things that I need in order to work on something.
Thanks to this approach of mine, at the age of 16 y.o. I was able to work pretty well on a lot of projects.
